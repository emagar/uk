First "meaningful vote" (15 January 2019)
https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-01-15/division/B975E889-89F5-42D3-9C18-7562AFD1977C/EuropeanUnion(Withdrawal)Act?outputType=Names

The meaningful vote took place in the House of Commons on 15 January 2019.[73] The vote was originally scheduled to be held on 11 December 2018 but on 10 December, May postponed it because it became clear the government's Brexit deal would be voted down.

In the absence of any significant changes in the positions of the political parties, as expected, the government was defeated in 15 January vote by 432 votes to 202. The 230-vote margin of defeat was the worst for any government in modern Parliamentary history

The second meaningful vote took place on 12 March 2019.

Third "meaningful vote" (29 March 2019)
https://hansard.parliament.uk/Commons/2019-03-29/division/B6052BBD-43BE-4A30-8365-E3A8B108009E/UnitedKingdom%E2%80%99SWithdrawalFromTheEuropeanUnion?outputType=Names

As parliament had agreed to an extension of Article 50 to 30 June the possibility of a third meaningful vote was raised however, the Speaker ruled that "the same proposition or substantially the same proposition" could not be brought back in the same parliamentary session. The Political Declaration was then removed from the ballot in order to make it a different proposition.

The third vote meaningful vote on the Withdrawal Agreement was then able to take place on 29 March 2019. May promised to resign as Prime Minister if the Withdrawal Agreement was passed. In the end, May's deal was voted down again, albeit by a smaller margin than in the previous two votes.

First Round of Indicative Votes (27 March 2019)
https://commonsvotes.digiminster.com/?Term=&FromDate=27%2F03%2F2018&ToDate=02%2F04%2F2019


As a result of the Letwin amendment's success, indicative votes on Parliament's preferred Brexit options were held on 27 March. Eight propositions were voted upon, of which all eight failed.

Motion	Proposer	Ayes	Noes	Abs.	Majority
No Deal	John Baron	160	400	74	240
"Common Market 2.0"	Nick Boles	189	283	162	94
EFTA membership	George Eustice	64	377	193	313
Customs union	Kenneth Clarke	265	271	98	6
Labour alternative	Jeremy Corbyn	237	307	90	70
Revocation to avoid No Deal	Joanna Cherry	184	293	157	109
Referendum on the Withdrawal Agreement	Margaret Beckett	268	295	71	27
"Managed No Deal"	Marcus Fysh	139	422	73	283
In a departure from parliamentary convention, all eight votes took place simultaneously, using ballot papers, rather than having MPs walk through lobbies to signify their vote.

Further indicative votes were held on 1 April on propositions chosen by the Speaker.

Motion	Proposer	Ayes	Noes	Abs.	Majority

with "Common Market 2.0"	Nick Boles	261	282	91	21

"Revocation of Article 50 to avoid No Deal"	Joanna Cherry	191	292	151	101
